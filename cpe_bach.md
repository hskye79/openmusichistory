# Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (1714–1788)

Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (1714–1788) is a German composer, the missing link we too rarely discuss—the composer who turned the ornate eloquence of his father’s world into the nervous, emotionally charged language that Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven would soon refine. I chose him precisely because this in‑between position keeps him unfairly out of the spotlight: “too modern” for Baroque enthusiasts, “too eccentric” for strict Classicists. By recovering C. P. E. Bach, we illuminate a moment when European music was redefining what it meant to feel, to improvise, and to astonish.
